= Upgrade `component-cert-manager` from `v3.x` to `v4.x`

Version 4.x is a major overhaul of the configuration parameters of the component,
https://github.com/projectsyn/component-cert-manager/releases/tag/v4.0.0[see Release Notes] for more details.

Most of the changes are backward compatible, but some changes might require manual steps.


== Migration steps

The migration steps are highly dependent on your configuration.

If you use the component with the default configuration, you don't need to do anything.

If you are using an the `acme_dns_api` parameter, you need to add at minimum the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
solvers:
  legacy-acme-dns:
    dns01:
      acmeDNS:
        accountSecretRef:
          key: acmedns.json
          name: acme-dns-client
        host: acme-dns-api.example.com
    selector:
      dnsNames:
        - example.com
        - '*.apps.example.com'

cluster_issuers:
  letsencrypt-staging:
    solverRefs:
      - legacy-acme-dns
  letsencrypt-production:
    solverRefs:
      - legacy-acme-dns

== Explanation of configuration changes

=== legacy `helm_values`

The Helm values for cert-manager have moved to `helmValues.cert_manager`.

[TIP]
====
This change is backward compatible, but migrating the values to the new structure is recommended.
====

=== legacy `dns01-recursive-nameservers`

The `dns01-recursive-nameservers` parameter has been replaced by `components.cert_manager.recursiveNameservers`.

[TIP]
====
This change is backward compatible, but migrating the values to the new structure is recommended.
====

=== legacy `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`

The parameters `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` have been replaced by `components.cert_manager.httpProxy`, `components.cert_manager.httpsProxy`, and `components.cert_manager.noProxy`.

[TIP]
====
This change is backward compatible, but migrating the values to the new structure is recommended.
====

=== legacy `letsencrypt_clusterissuers`

The dictionary `letsencrypt_clusterissuers` has been integrated into the `cluster_issuers` dictionary.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This change is *not* backward compatible, if you have disabled any of the letsencrypt cluster issuers, you need to remove them from the `cluster_issuers` dictionary.
xref:references/parameters.adoc#_cluster_issuers[See Example]
====

=== legacy `letsencrypt_email`

The `letsencrypt_email` parameter has been replaced by `components.cert_manager.email`.

[TIP]
====
This change is backward compatible, but migrating the values to the new structure is recommended.
====

=== legacy `acme_dns_api`

The `acme_dns_api` parameter has been replaced by `acmeClients`.

[TIP]
====
This change is backward compatible, but migrating the values to the new structure is recommended.
====

[WARNING]
====
Be aware that if you migrate the configuration to the new structure, the secrets for the acme-dns client will be renamed and thus cause a reregistration of your client.
We recommend to name the acme-dns client `acme-dns` to avoid any potential issues.
====

[WARNING]
====
If you are using the `acme_dns_api` parameter, you can't use `cluster_issuers.acmeClientRefs` to reference the acme-dns client.
You need to create a `solvers` entry for the `acme-dns` client and reference it from the `cluster_issuers` dictionary.
